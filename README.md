This is a micro project to keep me up to day with the language and framework. maintained during part of my free time if the language or framework has an important upgrade.

The idea is to make use and try out all benefits and tools provided and get an understanding of the capabilities, this is intended to be used by me as a code playground in my learning path and practices.
